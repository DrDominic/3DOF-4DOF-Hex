This code is meant to run on a [BotBoarduino](http://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-botboarduino-robot-controller.html) combined with a [SSC-32U](http://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-ssc-32u-usb-servo-controller.html) in an walking robot of hexapod configuration.
To compile, you will need our version of the [PS2X library](https://github.com/Lynxmotion/Arduino-PS2X). You can download the package [here](https://github.com/Lynxmotion/Arduino-PS2X/raw/master/PS2X_lib.zip).

If you are unsure how to install the library, plese check [this tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) from Arduino.
